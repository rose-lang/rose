/**
 * Some of the types we expose in our API hold reference-counted pointers to
 * Rust objects living in WebAssembly memory. To avoid memory leaks, we use this
 * finalization registry to free those objects once they are no longer
 * referenced by any JavaScript objects. The `free` callback here typically
 * holds onto an instance of the class generated by `wasm-bindgen`, which means
 * that instance itself can't be used as the target for finalization (since that
 * strong reference would prevent garbage collection); thus, we wrap each of
 * these instances in a canonical object which is the one we actually register.
 * This does mean that if a user reaches in and pulls out the wrapped object, it
 * could become invalid if they don't hold onto the wrapper, so those inner
 * fields must be treated as private.
